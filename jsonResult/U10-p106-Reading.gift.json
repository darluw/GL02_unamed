Many of us believe that this is the only kind of true love there is because we’ve been brought up on a diet of romantic pop songs and films that idealise love. We cling to the idea, even though we suspect it’s doomed to failure. After all, around 50 percent of marriages end in divorce in many western countries. So why is the soulmate myth so powerful? Maybe it’s because we don’t like thinking that life is messily random. Or we need a romantic way of describing intense physical attraction. Or maybe it’s just shorthand for the kind of overwhelming emotion we don’t quite understand.</p>\n<p>Throughout history, many great works of literature such as Shakespeare’s <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> have been based on the idea of romantic love, as have popular works of contemporary fiction such as <i>One Day</i> and <i>Twilight</i>. This isn’t a preoccupation found only in Western cultures either. A Chinese story about lovers destined to be together, regardless of social class, background or geography, dates back to the ninth century. Many of these stories have tragic endings; <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> being a famous example.</p>\n<p>The founding father of romance is often thought to be the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato.

A recent study on attitudes to long-term relationships found that couples who have been together a long time are more likely to refer to each other as ‘best friends’ rather than ‘soulmates’, and are unconvinced by the representation of romance in popular culture.
